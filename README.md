## About
	
</div>

- Nowadays, many devices operations are based on digital technology like a token-based digital identity device. The objective of this project in its simplest terms is to replace metallic keys by building a fully featured password enabled electronic security system prototype. 
- One such device is Password Based Door Open System Using LPC2148. With this kind of entry system, people no longer have to worry about lost or stolen keys and they never have to bring keys with them everywhere they go or hide them in secret places to keep them away from the hands of unauthorized individuals. 
- The secret numbers of the keypad door locks can be easily changed into another combination. When people feel that their current number combinations have been divulged to unauthorized individuals, they can always change the codes anytime. 
- In addition, if the current owners of the house decide to sell the property or have the house rented to others, they can always just let the new people living there know about the access codes to the locks. There is no need to change locks at all. 
- The aim of this project therefore, is to design and construct a keypad/password based electronic door access key that will be able to,
  
  - Eliminate the use of mechanical/metallic keys.  
  - Prevent events of key misplacements. 
  - Avoid excessive key duplication for everyone in the house. 
  - Make the apartment where it is installed more difficult to break into.
